# Movie-Recommendations-System-using-Python
Developed a system to study the underlying mechanism behind the ways videos on Youtube, movies on Netflix, music on Spotify, etc are recommended after we've watched or listened to something. This project was an understanding through learning initiative. Got to learn about the models these comanies use to analyse their data &amp; how they use the user data to improve their performance. Prepared the system using simple Python modules like Sci-kit learn, seaborn, matplotlib, pandas &amp; numpy. This was a Data Analysis project based on the primary data analysis tools.
